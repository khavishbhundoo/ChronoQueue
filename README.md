# ChronoQueue
ChronoQueue is a thread-safe, time-aware FIFO queue with automatic item expiration. It is designed for scenarios where you need time-based eviction of in-memory data, such as TTL-based task buffering, lightweight scheduling, or caching with strict ordering.
Internally, it combines a ConcurrentQueue for preserving FIFO ordering and a ConcurrentDictionary + PeriodicTimer for managing expiration and cleanup of stale items.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ FIFO ordering
- üïí Per-item TTL using `DateTimeOffset`
- üßπ Background cleanup every 100 ms for near realtime eviction of expired items 
- ‚ö° Fast in-memory access (no additional locks or semaphores at ChronoQueue level)
- üõ° Thread-safe, designed for high-concurrency use cases
- üßØ Disposal-aware and safe to use in long-lived applications

## üìò API Overview

### `ChronoQueue<T>`

| Method | Description                                                                                                                          |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Enqueue(ChronoQueueItem<T>)` | Adds an item with an expiration timestamp. Throws if item is already expired or queue is disposed.                                   |
| `TryDequeue(out T item)` | Attempts to dequeue the next **non-expired** item, otherwise return default(T) . Returns `true` if non-expired found otherwise false |
| `Count()` | Returns the current number of active (non-expired) items in the queue.                                                               |
| `Flush()` | Clears the queue and cache, resetting all internal state.                                                                            |
| `Dispose()` | Disposes all resources, cancels cleanup, and resets the queue.                                                                       |


**Note**: If `T` is a reference type that implements `IDisposable` , it is disposed on expiry only if `DisposeOnExpiry` was set to true when creating
`ChronoQueueItem`.

### `ChronoQueue<T>`



| Property          | Description                                                               |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Item`            | Adds an item of type T to the queue                                       |
| `ExpiresAt`       | Absolute time at which item T should expire in as a DateTimeOffset        |
| `DisposeOnExpiry` | Auto-dispose expired IDisposable items if true otherwise false by default |


Examples of usage for methods above can be found in this README and in unit tests

## üõë Exceptions

- **`ChronoQueueItemExpiredException`**  
  Thrown when you attempt to enqueue an item that has already expired. This ensures expired data does not enter the queue.

- **`ObjectDisposedException`**  
  Thrown if any method is invoked on the queue after it has been disposed. This protects against operations on invalid or released resources.

## üì¶ Usage
Install the package via NuGet:

`dotnet add package khavishbhundoo.ChronoQueue`

```csharp
using ChronoQueue;
var queue = new ChronoQueue<string>();

queue.Enqueue(new ChronoQueueItem<string>("Hello", DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddSeconds(10)));
queue.Enqueue(new ChronoQueueItem<string>("World", DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddSeconds(30)));
Console.WriteLine(queue.Count()); // 2

if (queue.TryDequeue(out var result))
{
    Console.WriteLine(result); // "Hello"
}
Console.WriteLine(queue.Count()); // 1 since "Hello" is dequeued
await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)); // wait for expiry 
queue.TryDequeue(out _) // false since no new fresh item is in queue
Console.WriteLine(queue.Count()); // 0  

```

### ‚è± Performance

| Method         | Time Complexity                  | Notes                                    |
|----------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `Enqueue`      | **O(1)**                         | Adds item to queue and MemoryCache       |
| `TryDequeue`   | **Best:** O(1)                   | First item is valid                      |
|                | **Worst:** O(n)                  | Scans over N expired items               |
| `Count()`      | **O(1)**                         | Atomic read via `Interlocked.Read`       |
| `Flush()`      | **O(n)**                         | Clears both queue and cache              |
| `Dispose()`    | **O(n)**                         | Calls `Flush()` + disposes all resources |

> ‚ùó Expired items are removed from the internal `ConcurrentDictionary` cache via background cleanup, but their **internal queue IDs remain until a dequeue attempt**.

ChronoQueue aims to _work correctly_ and meet reasonable expectations by default while being fast. Benchmarking results are available [here](https://github.com/khavishbhundoo/ChronoQueue/tree/main/benchmarks), check them out!
